Ordinary Differential Equations
===============================

We study :math:`1`-step algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations
(ODEs), and consider forward Euler and backward Euler discretizations. We show
that a forward Euler discretization requires a time step restriction for
stability, while a backward Euler discretization is unconditionally stable.
