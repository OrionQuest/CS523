CS523: Computer Graphics
========================

Welcome to CS 523! This course is an introduction to Physics-based animation
techniques in Computer Graphics, and covers a wide range of topics such as
rigid body dynamics, volumetric elastic solids, and incompressible fluids. The
class begins with an introduction to numerical methods for ordinary differential
equations, and each successive lecture builds upon the concepts covered in the
previous class.

| **Time:** 3:20PM - 4:40PM, Mondays/Wednesdays, Fall 2018
| **Place:** BE 253, Livingston

| **Instructor:** `Mridul Aanjaneya <https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ma635/>`_
| **Office:** CBIM Room 18
| **Office hours:** Monday (1PM - 2PM)
| **Email:** mridul.aanjaneya@rutgers.edu

**Email Policy:** You are welcome to email the instructor about class-related
issues. Please start your subject line with \"**CS 523:**\". However, please do
not always count on an immediate reply. Although most questions will be answered
quickly, in the worst case you will receive a reply during (or shortly after)
the instructors' *next* scheduled office hours.

**Grading Policy:** Grades will be awarded based on class participation, 3 homeworks, and a term project.
The final grade will be computed as follows:

    65% x (term project) + 3 x 10% x (homework) + 5% x (class participation)

**Class participation:** Participation in class will be
evaluated based on the number of classes attended, enthusiasm for answering the
instructor's questions, and willingness to help other students.

**Collaboration:** Students are encouraged to form teams for the term project.
However, **all homework must be done individually by each student**.

**Typing resources:** All homework should be typed. Students can choose their favorite
platform for typing out their homework, some commonly used softwares are
`Microsoft Word <https://products.office.com/en-us/word>`_, `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/get/>`_,
and `LyX <http://www.lyx.org/>`_. Thanks to a former student, Alex Ames, here is
a `LyX guide <https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ma635/courses/cs412-s15/lyx_guide/lyx_tips.pdf>`_
and associated `source files <https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ma635/courses/cs412-s15/lyx_guide/lyx_tips.zip>`_
